# Data Structures & Algorithm


Data structures: Arrangement of data so that they can be used efficiently in the memory.

Algorithm: Sequence of steps on data using an efficient data structure  to solve a given problem 

## Terminology

Data Base: Collection of info in permanent storage for faster retrieval and update.

Data Warehouse: Management of massive amount of legacy data (Data that is imp but not currently needed) for better analysis 

Big Data: Analysis of large and complex data that traditional data processing applications cannot deal with.

Memory layout in C Programming

When code starts it is copied into the main memory
Initialized and uninitialized data segments hold the Initialized and uninitialized global variables resp
Stacks: hold the memory occupied by the function
Heaps: Contain data that is requested by the program as dynamic memory
